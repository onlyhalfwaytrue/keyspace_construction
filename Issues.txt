Okay this is the final version, there are just a few slight issues that shouldnt take long to form solutions for
1)RESOLVED:- MULTIPLE FILES WITH SAME NAME NOW PRINT AS THE SAME NAME WITH COUNTS SUMMED UP

2) if our program reads in only one file, I implemented functionality for this but the filename is being stored as
a whole path, you can view this in the invertedIndexer.c source code.  This should also be a simple fix that would
be something along the lines of parsing the path to just get the filename.  The current code still works its just
the output will output the entire path instead of just the file :- WAS NOT ABLE TO REPLICATE

3) We need a readme.pdf to describe the functionality.  As it stands, we first build a file list, then we build a token
list that holds an int array of the same size as the file list.  This int array holds the counts that the token occurs
in each file.  Once we have indexed and counted all tokens, we build a final output list.  This output list is just the token
list with an added field in each token node to point to another list that contains ONLY the files that that token occurs in
and the count.  This list is built in the invertedIndexer.c file and it is built in proper order with the counts being
ordered from highest to lowest.  Finally we make our output file according to the proper format outlined in the assignment
description.
