In many ways I'll miss the good old days
Someday
Someday
It hurts to say but I want you to stay
Sometimes
Sometimes
When we was young, oh man did we have fun
Always
Always
Promises they break before they're made
Sometimes
Sometimes
My ex says I'm lacking in depth
I will do my best
You say you want to stand by my side
Darling your heads not right
